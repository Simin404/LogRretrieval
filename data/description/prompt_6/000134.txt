                                            * Detect any instances of acceleration or deceleration. Explain if braking occurs.
                                            * If possible, estimate the force or intensity of the acceleration/braking.
                                        **Environmental Conditions:**
                                            * Analyze the weather (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy, foggy) and road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy).
                                        **Significant Road Events:**
                                            * Recognize and describe any other vehicles on the road, including whether they surpass the driver or stay ahead.
                                            * Detect any pedestrians, cyclists, or other objects (e.g., road signs, traffic lights) in or near the road.
                                            * Note any changes in the surroundings, such as tunnels, bridges, intersections, or sharp turns approaching.
                                            * Report any traffic congestion, accidents, or emergency vehicles in view.

**Driving Conditions:**
                                            The video shows a city street with a mix of vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks. The weather appears to be cloudy, and the road is wet, suggesting it might be raining.
                                            The driver is navigating through an intersection, and there are traffic lights present, indicating a controlled traffic system.
                                            The vehicles are moving at a moderate speed, with occasional acceleration and deceleration, suggesting a normal flow of traffic.


**Environmental Factors:**
                                            The street is wet, indicating recent rain, and the cloudy weather suggests it might be a cooler day.
                                            The vehicles are driving on a city street with buildings and other infrastructure, including traffic lights and intersections.
