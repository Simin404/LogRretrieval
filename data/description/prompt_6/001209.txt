Interpret the video by identifying the driving conditions, environmental factors and any significant road events. ASSISTANT: **Driving Conditions:**
                                            * Identify and describe the speed of the vehicle.
                                            * Detect any instances of acceleration or deceleration. Explain if braking occurs.
                                            * If possible, estimate the force or intensity of the acceleration/braking.
                                        **Environmental Conditions:**
                                            * Analyze the weather (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy, foggy) and road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy).
                                        **Significant Road Events:**
                                            * Recognize and describe any other vehicles on the road, including whether they surpass the driver or stay ahead.
                                            * Detect any pedestrians, cyclists, or other objects (e.g., road signs, traffic lights) in or near the road.
                                            * Note any changes in the surroundings, such as tunnels, bridges, intersections, or sharp turns approaching.
                                            * Report any traffic congestion, accidents, or emergency vehicles in view. USER:   Describe the video with the format of                                                 **Driving conditions: ... **;                                                 **Environmental factors: ... **;                                                 **Significant events: ... **  


**Driving Conditions:**
                                            The video shows a rainy day with a truck driving on a highway. The truck is moving at a moderate speed, and there is no indication of sudden acceleration or deceleration. The truck is maintaining a steady pace.

                                            **Environmental Factors:**
                                            The weather is rainy, and the road appears to be wet, which suggests that the truck is driving on a wet surface.
                                            **Significant Events:**
                                            The truck is driving on a highway with other vehicles, including cars and trucks, and there are no pedestrians or cyclists visible in the video. The truck is passing a car on the right side of the road. There are no significant road events or changes in the surroundings, such as tunnels, bridges, or sharp turns approaching. The truck is driving in a straight line and maintaining a steady speed.
