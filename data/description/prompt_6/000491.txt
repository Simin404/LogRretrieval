                                            * Identify and describe the speed of the vehicle.
                                            * Detect any instances of acceleration or deceleration. Explain if braking occurs.
                                            * If possible, estimate the force or intensity of the acceleration/braking.
                                        **Environmental Conditions:**
                                            * Analyze the weather (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy, foggy) and road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy).
                                        **Significant Road Events:**
                                            * Recognize and describe any other vehicles on the road, including whether they surpass the driver or stay ahead.
                                            * Detect any pedestrians, cyclists, or other objects (e.g., road signs, traffic lights) in or near the road.
                                            * Note any changes in the surroundings, such as tunnels, bridges, intersections, or sharp turns approaching.
                                            * Report any traffic congestion, accidents, or emergency vehicles in view.
