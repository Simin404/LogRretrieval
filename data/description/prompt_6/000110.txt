Interpret the video by identifying the driving conditions, environmental factors and any significant road events. ASSISTANT: **Driving Conditions:**
                                            * Identify and describe the speed of the vehicle.
                                            * Detect any instances of acceleration or deceleration. Explain if braking occurs.
                                            * If possible, estimate the force or intensity of the acceleration/braking.
                                        **Environmental Conditions:**
                                            * Analyze the weather (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy, foggy) and road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy).
                                        **Significant Road Events:**
                                            * Recognize and describe any other vehicles on the road, including whether they surpass the driver or stay ahead.
                                            * Detect any pedestrians, cyclists, or other objects (e.g., road signs, traffic lights) in or near the road.
                                            * Note any changes in the surroundings, such as tunnels, bridges, intersections, or sharp turns approaching.
                                            * Report any traffic congestion, accidents, or emergency vehicles in view. USER:   Describe the video with the format of                                                 **Driving conditions: ... **;                                                 **Environmental factors: ... **;                                                 **Significant events: ... **  


**Driving Conditions:**
                                            The video shows a city street with a truck driving on a wet road. The truck is moving at a moderate speed, and there is no indication of acceleration or deceleration. The truck is braking gently, suggesting a slowing down to a stop.


**Environmental Factors:**
                                            The weather appears to be rainy, as the road is wet, and the truck's tires are making contact with the wet surface.


**Significant Events:**
                                            The truck is driving past a pedestrian crossing, and there is a traffic light ahead, indicating a controlled intersection. The truck is also passing a car on the right side, suggesting it is overtaking another vehicle.
