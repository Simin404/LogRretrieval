                                            * If possible, estimate the force or intensity of the acceleration/braking.
                                        **Environmental Conditions:**
                                            * Analyze the weather (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy, foggy) and road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy).
                                        **Significant Road Events:**
                                            * Recognize and describe any other vehicles on the road, including whether they surpass the driver or stay ahead.
                                            * Detect any pedestrians, cyclists, or other objects (e.g., road signs, traffic lights) in or near the road.
                                            * Note any changes in the surroundings, such as tunnels, bridges, intersections, or sharp turns approaching.
                                            * Report any traffic congestion, accidents, or emergency vehicles in view. USER:   Describe the video with the format of                                                 **Driving conditions: ... **;                                                 **Environmental factors: ... **;                                                 **Significant events: ... **  


**Driving Conditions:**
                                            The video shows a city street with a mix of vehicles, including cars, buses, and a truck. The buses are driving on the right side of the road, and the cars are on the left. The vehicles are moving at different speeds, with some accelerating and others decelerating. The truck is driving in the middle lane. The road appears to be wet, and there are traffic lights at various points.


**Environmental Factors:**
                                            The weather appears to be overcast, and the road is wet, which could indicate recent rain or a damp atmosphere.


**Significant Events:**
                                            The video captures a bus driving ahead of a car, and another bus is seen in the distance. There are also pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalks, and a truck is visible in the middle lane. Additionally, there is a traffic light at an intersection.
