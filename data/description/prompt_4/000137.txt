Also, analyze environmental factors like weather, lighting, and road conditions. Please describe any significant road events, such as vehicles overtaking, pedestrians crossing, or tunnels approaching. 


The video shows a car driving on a city street with buildings on both sides. The car is moving at a moderate speed, and there are no significant road events or pedestrians crossing the street. The lighting is dim, suggesting it might be either early morning or late evening. The road conditions appear to be clear, with no visible obstacles or hazards. The car's speed is consistent, and there are no indications of acceleration or braking patterns. The video does not provide enough information to determine the current speed of the vehicle accurately.
